Fork of [loebi-ch/nanoleaf](https://github.com/loebi-ch/nanoleaf). Pins a patched `aionanoleaf2` that tolerates Essentials devices whose root info payload has no `state`, and that accept object-shaped `effectsList` / `select` responses (NL77K1). Use upstream again once that fix is on PyPI.

**Nanoleaf** is an enhanced Home Assistant custom integration for Nanoleaf devices. It serves as a modern successor to the built-in core integration, adding support for the new **Nanoleaf Essentials** line and **4D Screen Mirroring** capabilities.

## ✨ Features & Improvements

While the built-in [Nanoleaf integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nanoleaf/) works well for legacy panels, it lacks support for newer hardware generations and features. **Nanoleaf** fills this gap:

* **💡 Nanoleaf Essentials Support:** Full support for the new Essentials line (Bulbs and Lightstrips) using the updated Nanoleaf API.
* **📺 Screen Mirroring (Nanoleaf 4D):** Control your Nanoleaf 4D Screen Mirror camera directly from Home Assistant. You can now select Screen Mirror modes (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D) directly from the effect list in HA.
* **🔄 Backwards Compatible:** Fully supports all older Nanoleaf devices (Shapes, Canvas, Lines, etc.) supported by the original integration.
* **⚙️ Updated Backend:** Built on the `aionanoleaf2` library, which unifies communication with both the legacy API and the new Essentials API.
